## VeDDRA - Veterinary Dictionary for Drug Related Affairs

The Veterinary Dictionary for Drug Related Affairs (VeDDRA) is a standardized international veterinary terminology used for adverse event reporting. It provides:

- Standardized veterinary adverse reaction terms
- Hierarchical organization of terms
- Species-specific terminology
- International harmonization

**VeDDRA Term Structure**:
- Terms are organized by hierarchy
- Each term has a unique code
- Terms are applicable to corresponding species
- Multiple versions exist (please check the `veddra_version` field)

                if "outcome" in r

## Best Practices

1. **Use Standard Species Names** - Using full scientific names or common names works best.
2. **Consider Breed Variations** - Spelling and naming conventions may vary.
3. **Check VeDDRA Versions** - Terminology may change between different versions.
4. **Account for Reporter Bias** - Differences exist in how veterinarians versus pet owners report.
5. **Filter by Serious Events** - Focus on clinically significant reactions.
6. **Consider Animal Demographics** - Age, weight, and reproductive status are highly important.
7. **Track Temporal Patterns** - Seasonal fluctuations may exist.
8. **Cross-Reference Products** - The same active ingredient may correspond to multiple brands.
9. **Analyze by Route** - Topical vs. systemic administration has different safety implications.
10. **Consider Species Differences** - Drugs affect different species differently.

## Reporting Sources

Animal drug adverse event reports come from:
- **Veterinarians** - Professional medical observations
- **Animal Owners** - Direct observations and concerns
- **Pharmaceutical Companies** - Required post-marketing surveillance
- **FDA Field Personnel** - Official investigations
- **Research Institutions** - Clinical studies
- **Other Sources** - Various origins

Reporting thresholds and levels of detail may vary across different sources.
