- LogP ≤ 5
- Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors ≤ 5
- Number of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors ≤ 10

**Usage:**
```python
mc.rules.basic_rules.rule_of_five(mol)
```

**Notes:**
- One of the most widely used filters in drug discovery
- Approximately 90% of orally active drugs comply with these rules
- Exceptions exist, particularly for natural products and antibiotics

---

### Veber Rule

- Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA) ≤ 140 Å²

**Usage:**
```python
mc.rules.basic_rules.rule_of_veber(mol)

```

**Notes:**
- PAINS compounds show activity in multiple assays via non-specific mechanisms
- Common false positives in screening campaigns

### Lilly Demerits Filter

**References:** Based on Eli Lilly medicinal chemistry rules

**Source:** 275 structural patterns accumulated over 18 years

**Purpose:** Identifying assay interference and problematic functional groups

**Demerit Categories:**

1. **High Demerits (>50):**
   - Known toxic groups
   - Highly reactive functional groups
   - Strong metal chelators

2. **Medium Demerits (20-50):**
   - Metabolic liability
   - Aggregation-prone structures
   - Frequent hitters

3. **Low Demerits (5-20):**
   - Minor concerns
   - Context-dependent issues

**Usage:**
```python
lilly_filter = mc.structural.LillyDemeritsFilters()
results = lilly_filter(mols=mol_list, n_jobs=-1)
```

**Return Format:**
```python
{
    "demerits": 35,
    "passes": True,  # (demerits ≤ 100)
    "matched_patterns": [
        {"pattern": "phenolic_ester", "demerits": 20},

## Important Notes

### False Positives and False Negatives

**Filters are guidelines, not absolute standards:**

1. **False Positives** (Good drugs flagged):
   - ~10% of marketed drugs do not comply with the Rule of Five
   - Natural products often violate standard rules
   - Prodrugs often intentionally break rules
   - Antibiotics and antivirals often fall outside the norms

2. **False Negatives** (Poor compounds pass):
   - Passing does not guarantee success
   - Cannot capture target-specific issues
   - Cannot fully predict in vivo properties

### Context-Specific Application

**Different research contexts require different standards:**

- **Target Class:** Kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels have different optimal property spaces
- **Mode of Action:** Small molecules vs PROTACs vs Molecular glues
- **Route of Administration:** Oral vs Intravenous (IV) vs Topical
- **Disease Area:** CNS vs Oncology vs Infectious diseases
- **Stage:** Screening vs Hit-to-Lead vs Lead Optimization

### Augmenting with Machine Learning

Modern approaches combine rules with Machine Learning (ML):

```python
# Rule-based pre-screening
rule_results = mc.rules.RuleFilters(rule_list=["rule_of_five"])(mols)
filtered_mols = [mol for mol, r in zip(mols, rule_results) if r["passes"]]

# ML model scoring on the filtered set
ml_scores = ml_model.predict(filtered_mols)

# Integrated decision making
final_candidates = [
    mol for mol, score in zip(filtered_mols, ml_scores)
    if score > threshold
]
```
