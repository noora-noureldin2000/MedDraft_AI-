# TDC Molecular Generation Oracles (Prediction Functions)

Oracles are functions that evaluate the quality of generated molecules across specific dimensions. TDC provides over 17 Oracle functions for molecular optimization tasks in de novo drug design.

## Overview

Oracles are used to measure molecular properties, primarily for two purposes:

1. **Goal-directed generation**: Optimizing molecules to maximize/minimize specific properties.
2. **Distribution learning**: Evaluating whether generated molecules match the expected property distribution.

## Using Oracles

### Basic Usage

```python
from tdc import Oracle

# Initialize oracle
oracle = Oracle(name='GSK3B')

# Evaluate a single molecule (SMILES string)
score = oracle('CC(C)Cc1ccc(cc1)C(C)C(O)=O')

# Evaluate multiple molecules
scores = oracle(['SMILES1', 'SMILES2', 'SMILES3'])
```

### Oracle Categories

TDC Oracles are categorized into the following groups based on the molecular properties being evaluated.

## Biochemical Oracles

Predicting the binding affinity or activity of molecules against biological targets.

## Physicochemical Property Oracles

Evaluating drug-likeness properties and ADME characteristics.

### Drug-likeness Oracles

**QED - Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness**

## Multi-objective Optimization

Combining multiple Oracles for multi-attribute optimization:

```python
from tdc import Oracle

# Initialize multiple oracles
qed_oracle = Oracle(name='QED')
sa_oracle = Oracle(name='SA')
drd2_oracle = Oracle(name='DRD2')

# Define custom scoring function
def multi_objective_score(smiles):
    qed = qed_oracle(smiles)
    sa = 1 / (1 + sa_oracle(smiles))  # Invert SA (lower is better)
    drd2 = drd2_oracle(smiles)

    # Weighted combination
    return 0.3 * qed + 0.3 * sa + 0.4 * drd2

# Evaluate molecule
score = multi_objective_score('CC(C)Cc1ccc(cc1)C(C)C(O)=O')
```

## Oracle Performance Considerations

### Speed
- **Fast**: QED, SA, LogP, MW, Lipinski (rule-based calculations)
- **Medium**: Target-specific machine learning models (DRD2, GSK3B, etc.)
- **Slow**: Docking-based Oracles (Vina, ASKCOS)

### Reliability
- Oracles are machine learning models trained on specific datasets
- May not generalize to all chemical spaces
- Recommended to use multiple Oracles to validate results

### Batch Processing
```python
# Efficient batch evaluation
oracle = Oracle(name='GSK3B')
smiles_list = ['SMILES1', 'SMILES2', ..., 'SMILES1000']
scores = oracle(smiles_list)  # Faster than calling individually
```

## Common Workflows

### Goal-directed Generation
```python
from tdc import Oracle
from tdc.generation import MolGen

# Load training data
data = MolGen(name='ChEMBL_V29')
train_smiles = data.get_data()['Drug'].tolist()

# Initialize oracle
oracle = Oracle(name='GSK3B')

# Generate molecules (user-implemented generative model)
# generated_smiles = generator.generate(n=1000)

# Evaluate generated molecules
scores = oracle(generated_smiles)
best_molecules = [(s, score) for s, score in zip(generated_smiles, scores)]
best_molecules.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

print(f"Top 10 molecules:")
for smiles, score in best_molecules[:10]:
    print(f"{smiles}: {score:.3f}")
```

### Distribution Learning
```python
from tdc import Oracle
import numpy as np

# Initialize oracle
oracle = Oracle(name='QED')

# Evaluate training set
train_scores = oracle(train_smiles)
train_mean = np.mean(train_scores)
train_std = np.std(train_scores)

# Evaluate generated set
gen_scores = oracle(generated_smiles)
gen_mean = np.mean(gen_scores)
gen_std = np.std(gen_scores)

# Compare distributions
print(f"Training: μ={train_mean:.3f}, σ={train_std:.3f}")
print(f"Generated: μ={gen_mean:.3f}, σ={gen_std:.3f}")
```

## Integration with TDC Benchmarks

```python
from tdc.generation import MolGen

# Use GuacaMol benchmark
data = MolGen(name='GuacaMol')

# Oracles are automatically integrated
# Each GuacaMol task has an associated oracle
benchmark_results = data.evaluate_guacamol(
    generated_molecules=your_molecules,
    oracle_name='GSK3B'
)
```

## Notes

- Oracle scores are predicted values, not experimental measurements
- Always validate top candidates through experiments
- Different Oracles may have different score ranges and interpretations
- Some Oracles require additional dependencies or API access
- Check Oracle documentation for detailed information: https://tdcommons.ai/functions/oracles/

## Adding Custom Oracles

Create custom Oracle functions:

```python
class CustomOracle:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your model/method
        pass

    def __call__(self, smiles):
        # Implement your scoring logic
        # Return score or list of scores
        pass

# Use it just like a built-in Oracle
custom_oracle = CustomOracle()
score = custom_oracle('CC(C)Cc1ccc(cc1)C(C)C(O)=O')
```
