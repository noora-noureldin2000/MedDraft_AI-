---

## Overview

Machine Learning (ML) conferences prioritize **novelty**, **rigorous empirical evaluation**, and **reproducibility**. Papers are reviewed based on the clarity of contributions, the strength of baselines, the comprehensiveness of ablation studies, and an honest discussion of limitations.

### Core Philosophy

> "Facts speak louder than words—your experiments should prove your arguments, not just your prose."

**Primary Goal**: To advance the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) through innovative methods validated by rigorous experimentation.

---

## Audience and Tone

### Target Audience

- Machine learning researchers and practitioners
- Experts in specific sub-fields
- Individuals familiar with recent literature
- Readers expecting technical depth and precision

### Tone Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Technical** | Rich in methodological details |
| **Precise** | Accurate terminology, no ambiguity |
| **Empirical** | Arguments are supported by experiments |
| **Direct** | Clearly stated contributions |
| **Honest** | Acknowledgment of limitations |

### Narrative Voice

- **First-person plural ("We")**: "We propose...", "Our method..."
- **Active voice**: "We introduce a novel architecture..."
- **Confident but restrained**: Strong arguments require strong evidence.

---

## Abstract

### Style Requirements

- **Dense and data-focused**
- **150-250 words** (varies by conference)
- **Results-first**: Include specific performance metrics
- **Fluid paragraphs** (not structured lists)

### Abstract Structure

1. **Problem** (1 sentence): What problem are you solving?
2. **Limitations of Existing Work** (1 sentence): Why are current methods insufficient?
3. **Your Method** (1-2 sentences): What is your approach?
4. **Key Results** (2-3 sentences): Specific numbers on benchmarks.
5. **Significance** (Optional, 1 sentence): Why does this matter?

### Abstract Example (NeurIPS Style)

```
Transformers have achieved remarkable success in sequence modeling but 
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, limiting their application 
to long sequences. We introduce FlashAttention-2, an IO-aware exact 
attention algorithm that achieves 2x speedup over FlashAttention and up 
to 9x speedup over standard attention on sequences up to 16K tokens. Our 
key insight is to reduce memory reads/writes by tiling and recomputation, 
achieving optimal IO complexity. On the Long Range Arena benchmark, 
FlashAttention-2 enables training with 8x longer sequences while matching 
standard attention accuracy. Combined with sequence parallelism, we train 
GPT-style models on sequences of 64K tokens at near-linear cost. We 
release optimized CUDA kernels achieving 80% of theoretical peak FLOPS 
on A100 GPUs. Code is available at [anonymous URL].
```

### Abstract Don'ts

❌ "We propose a novel method for X" (Too vague, no results)
❌ "Our method outperforms baselines" (No specific numbers)
❌ "This is an important problem" (Self-evident statement)

✅ Include specific metrics: "achieves 94.5% accuracy, 3.2% improvement"
✅ Include scale: "on 1M samples" or "16K token sequences"
✅ Include comparisons: "2x faster than previous SOTA"

## Introduction

### Structure (2-3 Pages)

ML paper introductions have a unique structure, often featuring a **numbered list of contributions**.

### Paragraph-by-Paragraph Guide

**Para 1: Problem Motivation**
- Why is this problem important?
- What are the application scenarios?
- Set the technical challenge.

```
"Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 
natural language understanding and generation. However, their quadratic 
attention complexity presents a fundamental bottleneck for processing 
long documents, multi-turn conversations, and reasoning over extended 
contexts. As models scale to billions of parameters and context lengths 
extend to tens of thousands of tokens, efficient attention mechanisms 
become critical for practical deployment."
```

**Para 2: Limitations of Existing Work**
- What methods exist?
- Why are they not good enough?
- Technical analysis of limitations.

```
"Prior work has addressed this through sparse attention patterns, 
linear attention approximations, and low-rank factorizations. While 
these methods reduce theoretical complexity, they often sacrifice 
accuracy, require specialized hardware, or introduce approximation 
errors that compound in deep networks. Exact attention remains 
preferable when computational resources permit."
```

**Para 3: Your Method (High-level Overview)**
- What is your core insight?
- How does your method work conceptually?
- Why will it succeed?

```
"We observe that the primary bottleneck in attention is not computation 
but rather memory bandwidth—reading and writing the large N×N attention 
matrix dominates runtime on modern GPUs. We propose FlashAttention-2, 
which eliminates this bottleneck through a novel tiling strategy that 
computes attention block-by-block without materializing the full matrix."
```

**Para 4: List of Contributions (Crucial)**

This is a **mandatory and highly characteristic** part of ML conference papers:

```
Our contributions are as follows:

• We propose FlashAttention-2, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm 
  that achieves optimal memory complexity O(N²d/M) where M is GPU 
  SRAM size.

• We provide theoretical analysis showing that our algorithm achieves 
  2-4x fewer HBM accesses than FlashAttention on typical GPU 
  configurations.

• We demonstrate 2x speedup over FlashAttention and up to 9x over 
  standard PyTorch attention across sequence lengths from 256 to 64K 
  tokens.

• We show that FlashAttention-2 enables training with 8x longer 
  contexts on the same hardware, unlocking new capabilities for 
  long-range modeling.

• We release optimized CUDA kernels and PyTorch bindings at 
  [anonymous URL].
```

### Contribution Guidelines

| Good Contribution Item | Poor Contribution Item |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Specific and quantifiable | Vague claims |
| Self-contained (readable alone) | Requires reading the whole paper to understand |
| Clearly distinct from other items | Repetitive or overlapping content |
| Emphasizes novelty | States obvious facts |

### Placement of Related Work

- **In Introduction**: Brief positioning (1-2 paragraphs).
- **Standalone Section**: Detailed comparison (placed at the end or before conclusion).
- **Appendix**: Extended discussion when space is limited.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Ablation Studies (Mandatory)

Show what factors in your method are actually working:

```

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Variant                              | Speedup | Memory
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Full FlashAttention-2                |   2.0x  |  1.0x
  - without sequence parallelism     |   1.7x  |  1.0x
  - without recomputation            |   1.3x  |  2.4x
  - without block tiling             |   1.0x  |  4.0x
FlashAttention-1 (baseline)          |   1.0x  |  1.0x
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### What Ablations Should Show

- **Every component matters**: Removing it hurts performance.
- **Justification of design choices**: Why this architecture/hyperparameter?
- **Failure modes**: When does the method not work?
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Robustness to hyperparameters.

## Related Work

### Placement Options

1. **After Introduction**: Common in Computer Vision (CV) papers.
2. **Before Conclusion**: Common in NeurIPS/ICML.
3. **Appendix**: When space is extremely tight.

### Writing Style

- **Organize by theme**: Not chronologically.
- **Position your work**: How you differ from each branch of work.
- **Fair descriptions**: Do not misrepresent previous work.
- **Recent citations**: Include papers from 2023-2024.

### Example Structure

```
**Efficient Attention Mechanisms.** Prior work on efficient attention 
falls into three categories: sparse patterns (Beltagy et al., 2020; 
Zaheer et al., 2020), linear approximations (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; 
Choromanski et al., 2021), and low-rank factorizations (Wang et al., 
2020). Our work differs in that we focus on IO-efficient exact 
attention rather than approximations.

**Memory-Efficient Training.** Gradient checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016) 
and activation recomputation (Korthikanti et al., 2022) reduce memory 
by trading compute. We adopt similar ideas but apply them within the 
attention operator itself.
```

## Limitations Section

### Why It Matters

NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR **increasingly require** this. An honest limitation analysis:
- Shows scientific maturity.
- Guides future work.
- Prevents overclaiming.

### What to Include

1. **Methodological limitations**: When does it fail?
2. **Experimental limitations**: What wasn't tested?
3. **Scope limitations**: What is outside the discussion?
4. **Computational limitations**: Resource requirements.

### Limitations Section Example

```
**Limitations.** While FlashAttention-2 provides substantial speedups, 
several limitations remain. First, our implementation is optimized for 
NVIDIA GPUs and does not support AMD or other hardware. Second, the 
speedup is most pronounced for medium to long sequences; for very short 
sequences (<256 tokens), the overhead of our kernel launch dominates. 
Third, we focus on dense attention; extending our approach to sparse 
attention patterns remains future work. Finally, our theoretical 
analysis assumes specific GPU memory hierarchy parameters that may not 
hold for future hardware generations.
