## High-Impact Journals (Nature, Science, Cell)

### Core Philosophy

High-impact multidisciplinary journals prioritize **broad impact** over technical depth. The core question is not just "Is this technically rigorous?" but "Why should a scientist outside this specific field care?"

### Key Writing Principles

1.  **Start with the Big Picture**: Open by explaining why this research matters to science or society.
2.  **Minimize Jargon**: Define technical terms; prioritize common vocabulary.
3.  **Tell a Story**: Present results as a narrative rather than a mere data dump.
4.  **Emphasize Significance**: What does this change about our understanding?
5.  **Accessible Figures**: Conceptual schematics and model diagrams are preferred over raw data plots.

### Structural Differences

**Nature/Science** vs. **Specialized Journals**:

| Element | Nature/Science | Specialized Journals |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Introduction | 3-4 paragraphs, broad to specific | Exhaustive literature review |
| Methods | Usually in Supplement or brief summary | Detailed in the main text |
| Results | Organized by findings/storyline | Organized by experiment |
| Discussion | Significance first, then limitations | Detailed comparison with literature |
| Figures | Focus on conceptual schematics | Focus on raw data |

### Example: Same Finding, Different Styles

**Nature Style**:
> "We discovered that protein X acts as a molecular switch controlling cell fate decisions during development, resolving a longstanding question about how stem cells choose their destiny."

**Specialized Journal Style**:
> "Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we demonstrate that protein X (encoded by gene ABC1) regulates the expression of pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog through direct promoter binding, as confirmed by ChIP-seq analysis (n=3 biological replicates, FDR < 0.05)."

## Medical Journals (NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, BMJ)

### Core Philosophy

Medical journals prioritize **clinical relevance** and **patient outcomes**. Every finding must be linked to medical practice.

### Key Writing Principles

1.  **Patient-Centered Language**: Use "patients receiving treatment X" rather than "subjects in treatment X."
2.  **Strength of Evidence**: Use cautious phrasing based on the study design.
3.  **Clinical Actionability**: Address the "So what?" for clinicians (practical utility).
4.  **Absolute Numbers**: Report absolute risk reduction, not just relative values.
5.  **Structured Abstracts**: Must include labeled sections.

### Structured Abstract Format (Medical)

```
Background: [1-2 sentences describing the problem and rationale]

Methods: [Study design, setting, participants, interventions, outcomes, analysis]

Results: [Primary outcomes with confidence intervals, secondary outcomes, adverse events]

Conclusions: [Clinical implications, acknowledgment of limitations]
```

### Evidence Language Standards

| Study Design | Appropriate Language |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) | "Treatment X reduced mortality by..." |
| Observational Study | "Treatment X was associated with reduced mortality..." |
| Case Series | "These findings suggest that treatment X may..." |
| Case Report | "This case illustrates that treatment X can..." |

## ML/AI Conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR)

### Core Philosophy

ML conferences value **novelty**, **rigorous experimentation**, and **reproducibility**. The focus is on advancing the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) through empirical evidence.

### Key Writing Principles

1.  **Contribution List**: Use bullet points in the introduction to list specific innovations.
2.  **Baselines are Crucial**: Compare against strong, recent baseline models.
3.  **Ablations are Mandatory**: Show which parts of the method actually work.
4.  **Reproducibility**: Provide random seeds, hyperparameters, and compute requirements.
5.  **Limitations Section**: Honestly acknowledge shortcomings (increasingly required).

### Introduction Structure (ML Conference)

```
[Para 1: Problem Motivation - Why this matters]

[Para 2: Limitations of existing methods]

[Para 3: Our approach (High-level overview)]

Our contributions are as follows:
• We propose [method name], a novel approach to [problem] that [key innovation].
• We provide theoretical analysis showing [guarantees/properties].
• We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on [benchmarks], improving over [baseline] by [X%].
• We release code and models at [anonymous URL for review].
```

### Abstract Style (ML Conference)

ML abstracts are typically **dense and figure-focused**:

> "We present TransformerX, a novel architecture for long-range sequence modeling that achieves O(n log n) complexity while maintaining expressivity. On the Long Range Arena benchmark, TransformerX achieves 86.2% average accuracy, outperforming Transformer (65.4%) and Performer (78.1%). On language modeling, TransformerX matches GPT-2 perplexity (18.4) using 40% fewer parameters. We provide theoretical analysis showing TransformerX can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence function."

### Experimental Section Expectations

1.  **Datasets**: Standard benchmarks, dataset statistics.
2.  **Baselines**: Strong recent methods, fair comparison.
3.  **Main Results Table**: Clear and detailed.
4.  **Ablation Studies**: Systematically removing/modifying components.
5.  **Analysis**: Error analysis, qualitative examples, failure cases.
6.  **Compute Cost**: Training time, inference speed, VRAM usage.

## Computer Science Conferences (ACL, EMNLP, CHI, SIGKDD)

### ACL/EMNLP (Natural Language Processing)

-   **Task-Focused**: Clear problem definition.
-   **Benchmark-Heavy**: Standard datasets (GLUE, SQuAD, etc.).
-   **Emphasis on Error Analysis**: Where does it fail?
-   **Human Evaluation**: Often expected alongside automatic metrics.
-   **Ethics Statement**: Bias, fairness, environmental cost.

### CHI (Human-Computer Interaction)

-   **User-Centric**: Focus on people, not just technology.
-   **Study Design Details**: Participant recruitment, IRB approval.
-   **Qualitative Acceptance**: Interview studies and ethnography are valid.
-   **Design Implications**: Specific takeaways for practitioners.
-   **Accessibility/Inclusivity**: Consideration of diverse user groups.

### SIGKDD (Data Mining)

-   **Emphasis on Scalability**: Handling large-scale data.
-   **Real-world Applications**: Value placed on industrial datasets.
-   **Efficiency Metrics**: Time and space complexity.
-   **Innovation in Method or Application**: Both paths are recognized.

## Common Style Mistakes by Venue

### Nature/Science Submissions

❌ Too technical: "We used CRISPR-Cas9 with sgRNAs targeting exon 3..."
✅ Accessible: "Using gene-editing technology, we disabled the gene..."

❌ Dry opening: "Protein X is involved in cellular signaling..."
✅ Engaging opening: "How do cells decide their fate? We discovered that..."

### ML Conference Submissions

❌ Vague contributions: "We present a new method for X"
✅ Specific contributions: "We propose Method Y that achieves Z% improvement on benchmark W"

❌ Missing ablations: Only showing results for the full method.
✅ Complete: Table showing the contribution of each component.

### Medical Journal Submissions

❌ Missing absolute values: "50% reduction in risk"
✅ Complete: "50% relative reduction (ARR 2.5%, NNT 40)"

❌ Causal language for observational data: "Treatment caused improvement"
✅ Appropriate: "Treatment was associated with improvement"
