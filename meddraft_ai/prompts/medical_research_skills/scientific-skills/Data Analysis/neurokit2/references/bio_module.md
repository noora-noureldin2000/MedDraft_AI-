# Multi-Signal Integration (Bio Module)

## Overview

The Bio module provides unified functions for processing and analyzing multiple physiological signals simultaneously. It acts as a wrapper, coordinating signal-specific processing functions and implementing integrated multi-modal analysis.

## Multi-Signal Processing

### bio_process()

Process multiple physiological signals simultaneously with a single function call.

```python
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=None, rsp=None, eda=None, emg=None,
                                       ppg=None, eog=None, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Parameters:**
- `ecg`: ECG signal array (optional)
- `rsp`: Respiration signal array (optional)
- `eda`: EDA signal array (optional)
- `emg`: EMG signal array (optional)
- `ppg`: PPG signal array (optional)
- `eog`: EOG signal array (optional)
- `sampling_rate`: Sampling rate in Hz (must be consistent across signals, or specified individually for each)

**Returns:**
- `bio_signals`: A unified DataFrame containing all processed signals, with columns including:
  - Signal-specific features (e.g., `ECG_Clean`, `ECG_Rate`, `EDA_Phasic`, `RSP_Rate`)
  - All detected events/peaks
  - Derived metrics
- `bio_info`: A dictionary containing signal-specific information (peak locations, parameters)

**Example:**
```python
# Process ECG, Respiration, and EDA simultaneously
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(
    ecg=ecg_signal,
    rsp=rsp_signal,
    eda=eda_signal,
    sampling_rate=1000
)

# Access processed signals
ecg_clean = bio_signals['ECG_Clean']
rsp_rate = bio_signals['RSP_Rate']
eda_phasic = bio_signals['EDA_Phasic']

# Access detected peaks
ecg_peaks = bio_info['ECG']['ECG_R_Peaks']
rsp_peaks = bio_info['RSP']['RSP_Peaks']
```

**Internal Workflow:**
1. Each signal is processed by its dedicated processing function:
   - `ecg_process()` for ECG
   - `rsp_process()` for Respiration
   - `eda_process()` for EDA
   - `emg_process()` for EMG
   - `ppg_process()` for PPG
   - `eog_process()` for EOG
2. Results are merged into a unified DataFrame.
3. Cross-signal features are calculated (e.g., RSA if both ECG and RSP are present).

**Advantages:**
- Simplifies the API for multi-modal recordings.
- All signals share a unified time base.
- Automatic calculation of cross-signal features.
- Consistent output format.

## Multi-Signal Analysis

### bio_analyze()

Performs a comprehensive analysis of processed multi-modal signals.

```python
bio_results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Parameters:**
- `bio_signals`: DataFrame from `bio_process()` or custom processed signals.
- `sampling_rate`: Sampling rate (Hz).

**Returns:**
- A DataFrame containing analysis results for all detected signal types:
  - Interval-related metrics (if duration ≥ 10 seconds).
  - Event-related metrics (if duration < 10 seconds).
  - Cross-signal metrics (e.g., RSA if ECG + RSP are available).

**Metrics Calculated by Signal:**
- **ECG**: Heart rate statistics, HRV metrics (time, frequency, and non-linear domains).
- **RSP**: Respiration rate statistics, RRV, amplitude measurements.
- **EDA**: SCR count, amplitude, tonic level, sympathetic indices.
- **EMG**: Activation count, amplitude statistics.
- **PPG**: Similar to ECG (Heart rate, HRV).
- **EOG**: Blink count, blink rate.

**Cross-Signal Metrics:**
- **RSA (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia)**: If ECG + RSP are present.
- **Cardiorespiratory coupling**: Phase synchronization indices.
- **Multi-modal arousal**: Combined autonomic indices.

**Example:**
```python
# Analyze processed signals
results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)

# Access results
heart_rate_mean = results['ECG_Rate_Mean']
hrv_rmssd = results['HRV_RMSSD']
breathing_rate = results['RSP_Rate_Mean']
scr_count = results['SCR_Peaks_N']
rsa_value = results['RSA']  # If both ECG and RSP are present
```

## Cross-Signal Features

When multiple signals are processed together, NeuroKit2 can calculate integrated features:

### Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)

Automatically calculated when both ECG and Respiration signals are present.

```python
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=ecg, rsp=rsp, sampling_rate=1000)
results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)

rsa = results['RSA']  # Automatically included
```

**Calculation Methods:**
- High-frequency HRV modulation caused by respiration.
- Requires synchronized ECG R-peaks and respiration signals.
- Methods: Porges-Bohrer or Peak-to-trough.

**Interpretation:**
- Higher RSA: Greater parasympathetic (vagal) influence.
- Marker of cardiorespiratory coupling.
- Indicator of health and emotional regulation capacity.

### ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR)

If a respiration signal is unavailable, NeuroKit2 can estimate it from the ECG:

```python
ecg_signals, ecg_info = nk.ecg_process(ecg, sampling_rate=1000)

# Extract EDR
edr = nk.ecg_rsp(ecg_signals['ECG_Clean'], sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Estimating respiration when direct measurement is missing.
- Cross-validating respiration measurements.

### ECG-EDA Integration

Synchronized cardiac and electrodermal activity:

```python
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=ecg, eda=eda, sampling_rate=1000)

# Both signals are available for integrated analysis
ecg_rate = bio_signals['ECG_Rate']
eda_phasic = bio_signals['EDA_Phasic']

# Calculate correlation or coupling indices
correlation = ecg_rate.corr(eda_phasic)
```

## Practical Workflow

### Full Multi-Modal Recording Analysis

```python
import neurokit2 as nk
import pandas as pd

# 1. Load multi-modal physiological data
ecg = load_ecg()        # Your data loading function
rsp = load_rsp()
eda = load_eda()
emg = load_emg()

# 2. Process all signals simultaneously
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(
    ecg=ecg,
    rsp=rsp,
    eda=eda,
    emg=emg,
    sampling_rate=1000
)

# 3. Visualize processed signals
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(15, 12), sharex=True)

# ECG
axes[0].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['ECG_Clean'])
axes[0].set_ylabel('ECG')
axes[0].set_title('Multi-Modal Physiological Recording')

# Respiration
axes[1].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['RSP_Clean'])
axes[1].set_ylabel('Respiration')

# EDA
axes[2].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['EDA_Phasic'])
axes[2].set_ylabel('EDA (Phasic)')

# EMG
axes[3].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['EMG_Amplitude'])
axes[3].set_ylabel('EMG Amplitude')
axes[3].set_xlabel('Time (s)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# 4. Analyze all signals
results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)

# 5. Extract key metrics
print("Heart Rate (mean):", results['ECG_Rate_Mean'])
print("HRV (RMSSD):", results['HRV_RMSSD'])
print("Breathing Rate:", results['RSP_Rate_Mean'])
print("SCRs (count):", results['SCR_Peaks_N'])
print("RSA:", results['RSA'])
```

### Event-Related Multi-Modal Analysis

```python
# 1. Process signals
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=ecg, rsp=rsp, eda=eda, sampling_rate=1000)

# 2. Detect events
events = nk.events_find(trigger_channel, threshold=0.5)

# 3. Create Epochs for all signals
epochs = nk.epochs_create(bio_signals, events, sampling_rate=1000,
                          epochs_start=-1.0, epochs_end=10.0,
                          event_labels=event_labels,
                          event_conditions=event_conditions)

# 4. Signal-specific event-related analysis
ecg_eventrelated = nk.ecg_eventrelated(epochs)
rsp_eventrelated = nk.rsp_eventrelated(epochs)
eda_eventrelated = nk.eda_eventrelated(epochs)

# 5. Merge results
all_results = pd.merge(ecg_eventrelated, rsp_eventrelated,
                       left_index=True, right_index=True)
all_results = pd.merge(all_results, eda_eventrelated,
                       left_index=True, right_index=True)

# 6. Statistical comparison by condition
all_results['Condition'] = event_conditions
condition_means = all_results.groupby('Condition').mean()
```

### Different Sampling Rates

Handling signals with different native sampling rates:

```python
# ECG at 1000 Hz, EDA at 100 Hz
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(
    ecg=ecg_1000hz,
    eda=eda_100hz,
    sampling_rate=1000  # Target sampling rate
)
# EDA will be automatically resampled to 1000 Hz internally
```

Or process separately and merge:

```python
# Process at native sampling rates
ecg_signals, ecg_info = nk.ecg_process(ecg, sampling_rate=1000)
eda_signals, eda_info = nk.eda_process(eda, sampling_rate=100)

# Resample to a common frequency
eda_resampled = nk.signal_resample(eda_signals, sampling_rate=100,
                                   desired_sampling_rate=1000)

# Merge manually
bio_signals = pd.concat([ecg_signals, eda_resampled], axis=1)
```

## Use Cases and Applications

### Comprehensive Psychophysiological Research

Capturing multiple dimensions of physiological arousal:

- **Cardiac**: Orienting response, attention, emotional valence.
- **Respiration**: Arousal, stress, emotional regulation.
- **EDA**: Sympathetic arousal, emotional intensity.
- **EMG**: Muscle tension, facial expressions, startle response.

**Example: Emotional Picture Viewing**
- ECG: Heart rate deceleration during viewing (attention).
- EDA: SCR reflects emotional arousal intensity.
- RSP: Breath-holding or changes reflect emotional engagement.
- Facial EMG: Corrugator (frown), Zygomaticus (smile) reflect emotional valence.

### Stress and Relaxation Assessment

Multi-modal markers provide converging evidence:

- **Increased Stress**: ↑ HR, ↓ HRV, ↑ EDA, ↑ Respiration rate, ↑ Muscle tension.
- **Relaxation**: ↓ HR, ↑ HRV, ↓ EDA, ↓ Respiration rate, slow breathing, ↓ Muscle tension.

**Intervention Effects:**
- Compare multi-modal metrics before and after intervention.
- Identify which modalities respond to specific techniques.

### Clinical Assessment

**Anxiety Disorders:**
- Elevated baseline EDA and HR.
- Exaggerated responses to stressors.
- Reduced HRV and respiration variability.

**Depression:**
- Altered autonomic balance (↓ HRV).
- Blunted EDA reactivity.
- Irregular respiration patterns.

**PTSD:**
- Hyperarousal (↑ HR, ↑ EDA baseline).
- Exaggerated startle response (EMG).
- Altered RSA.

### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

Non-invasive user state assessment:

- **Cognitive Load**: ↓ HRV, ↑ EDA, suppressed eye blinks.
- **Frustration**: ↑ HR, ↑ EDA, ↑ Muscle tension.
- **Engagement**: Moderate arousal, synchronized responses.
- **Boredom**: Low arousal, irregular patterns.

### Sports Performance and Recovery

Monitoring training load and recovery:

- **Resting HRV**: Daily monitoring to prevent overtraining.
- **EDA**: Sympathetic activation and stress.
- **Respiration**: Breathing patterns during exercise/recovery.
- **Multi-modal Integration**: Comprehensive recovery assessment.

## Advantages of Multi-Modal Recording

**Convergent Validity:**
- Multiple indicators pointing to the same construct (e.g., arousal).
- More robust than single-measurements.

**Discriminant Validity:**
- Different signals decouple under certain conditions.
- ECG reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
- EDA primarily reflects sympathetic activity.

**System Integration:**
- Understanding whole-body physiological coordination.
- Cross-signal coupling metrics (RSA, coherence).

**Redundancy and Robustness:**
- If one signal quality is poor, others are still available.
- Cross-modal validation of findings.

**Richer Interpretation:**
- HR deceleration + SCR increase = Orienting response with arousal.
- HR acceleration + No SCR = Cardiac response without sympathetic arousal.

## Considerations

### Hardware and Synchronization

- **Same Device**: Signals are inherently synchronized.
- **Different Devices**: Require common triggers/timestamps.
  - Use hardware triggers to mark simultaneous events.
  - Software alignment based on event markers.
  - Verify sync quality (cross-correlation analysis on redundant signals).

### Signal Quality by Modality

- Not all signals will have the same quality.
- Prioritize based on the research question.
- Document quality issues for each signal.

### Computational Cost

- Processing multiple signals increases computation time.
- For large datasets, consider batch processing.
- Downsample appropriately to reduce load.

### Analysis Complexity

- More signals = More variables = More statistical comparisons.
- Risk of Type I errors (false positives) without correction.
- Use multivariate methods or pre-registered analyses.

### Interpretation

- Avoid over-interpreting complex multi-modal patterns.
- Ground interpretations in physiological theory.
- Replicate findings before making strong claims.
