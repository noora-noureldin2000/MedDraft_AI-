# Electrodermal Activity (EDA) Analysis

## Overview

Electrodermal Activity (EDA), also known as Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) or Skin Conductance (SC), reflects the level of sympathetic nervous system arousal and sweat gland activity by measuring the electrical conductivity of the skin. EDA is widely used in psychophysiology, affective computing, and polygraphy.

## Main Processing Pipeline

### eda_process()

Automatically processes raw EDA signals, returning Tonic/Phasic decomposition results and Skin Conductance Response (SCR) features.

```python
signals, info = nk.eda_process(eda_signal, sampling_rate=100, method='neurokit')
```

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. Signal cleaning (low-pass filtering)
2. Tonic-phasic decomposition
3. Skin Conductance Response (SCR) detection
4. SCR feature extraction (onsets, peaks, amplitude, rise/recovery time)

**Return Values:**
- `signals`: A DataFrame containing the following columns:
  - `EDA_Clean`: Filtered signal
  - `EDA_Tonic`: Slowly changing baseline
  - `EDA_Phasic`: Fast-changing response
  - `SCR_Onsets`, `SCR_Peaks`, `SCR_Height`: Response markers
  - `SCR_Amplitude`, `SCR_RiseTime`, `SCR_RecoveryTime`: Response features
- `info`: A dictionary containing processing parameters

**Methods:**
- `'neurokit'`: cvxEDA decomposition + neurokit peak detection
- `'biosppy'`: Median smoothing + biosppy method

## Preprocessing Functions

### eda_clean()

Removes noise through low-pass filtering.

```python
cleaned_eda = nk.eda_clean(eda_signal, sampling_rate=100, method='neurokit')
```

**Methods:**
- `'neurokit'`: Low-pass Butterworth filter (3 Hz cutoff frequency)
- `'biosppy'`: Low-pass Butterworth filter (5 Hz cutoff frequency)

**Automatic Skip:**
- If sampling rate < 7 Hz, cleaning is skipped (assumed to be already low-pass filtered)

**Principles:**
- EDA frequency components are typically between 0-3 Hz
- Removes high-frequency noise and motion artifacts
- Preserves slow SCRs (typical rise time of 1-3 seconds)

### eda_phasic()

Decomposes EDA into Tonic (slow baseline) and Phasic (fast response) components.

```python
tonic, phasic = nk.eda_phasic(eda_cleaned, sampling_rate=100, method='cvxeda')
```

**Methods:**

**1. cvxEDA (Default, Recommended):**
```python
tonic, phasic = nk.eda_phasic(eda_cleaned, sampling_rate=100, method='cvxeda')
```
- Convex optimization approach (Greco et al., 2016)
- Sparse phasic driver model
- Physiologically most accurate
- Computationally intensive but provides superior decomposition

**2. Median Smoothing:**
```python
tonic, phasic = nk.eda_phasic(eda_cleaned, sampling_rate=100, method='smoothmedian')
```
- Median filter with configurable window
- Fast and simple
- Lower accuracy than cvxEDA

**3. High-pass Filtering (Biopac's Acqknowledge):**
```python
tonic, phasic = nk.eda_phasic(eda_cleaned, sampling_rate=100, method='highpass')
```
- Extracts phasic component via high-pass filtering (0.05 Hz)
- Fast computation
- Tonic component derived by subtraction

**4. SparsEDA:**
```python
tonic, phasic = nk.eda_phasic(eda_cleaned, sampling_rate=100, method='sparseda')
```
- Sparse deconvolution method
- Alternative optimization approach

**Return Values:**
- `tonic`: Slowly changing Skin Conductance Level (SCL)
- `phasic`: Fast-changing Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs)

**Physiological Interpretation:**
- **Tonic (SCL)**: Baseline arousal, general activation state, hydration
- **Phasic (SCR)**: Event-related responses, orientation, emotional reactions

### eda_peaks()

Detects Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) in the phasic component.

```python
peaks, info = nk.eda_peaks(eda_phasic, sampling_rate=100, method='neurokit',
                           amplitude_min=0.1)
```

**Methods:**
- `'neurokit'`: Optimized for reliability with configurable thresholds
- `'gamboa2008'`: Gamboa algorithm
- `'kim2004'`: Kim method
- `'vanhalem2020'`: Van Halem method
- `'nabian2018'`: Nabian algorithm

**Key Parameters:**
- `amplitude_min`: Minimum SCR amplitude (default: 0.1 µS)
  - Too low: Noise creates false positives
  - Too high: Misses small but valid responses
- `rise_time_max`: Maximum rise time (default: 2 seconds)
- `rise_time_min`: Minimum rise time (default: 0.01 seconds)

**Return Values:**
- A dictionary containing:
  - `SCR_Onsets`: Indices of SCR starts
  - `SCR_Peaks`: Indices of peak amplitudes
  - `SCR_Height`: Peak height above baseline
  - `SCR_Amplitude`: Amplitude from onset to peak
  - `SCR_RiseTime`: Duration from onset to peak
  - `SCR_RecoveryTime`: Duration from peak to recovery (50% decay)

**SCR Timing Conventions:**
- **Latency**: 1-3 seconds after stimulus (typical)
- **Rise time**: 0.5-3 seconds
- **Recovery time**: 2-10 seconds (to 50% recovery)
- **Minimum amplitude**: 0.01-0.05 µS (detection threshold)

### eda_fixpeaks()

Corrects detected SCR peaks (currently a placeholder for EDA).

```python
corrected_peaks = nk.eda_fixpeaks(peaks)
```

**Note:** Due to slower EDA dynamics, this step is less critical for EDA than for ECG signals.

## Analysis Functions

### eda_analyze()

Automatically selects the appropriate analysis type based on data duration.

```python
analysis = nk.eda_analyze(signals, sampling_rate=100)
```

**Mode Selection:**

### eda_autocor()

Calculates autocorrelation to assess the temporal structure of the EDA signal.

```python

```

**Parameters:**
- `lag`: Time lag in seconds (default: 4 seconds)

**Interpretation:**
- High autocorrelation: Persistent and slowly changing signal

```

**Methods:**

```python
nk.eda_plot(signals, info, static=True)
```

**Displays:**
- Raw and cleaned EDA signals

## Simulation and Testing

### eda_simulate()

## Practical Considerations

### Sampling Rate Recommendations
- **Minimum**: 10 Hz (sufficient to capture slow SCRs)
- **Standard**: 20-100 Hz (most commercial systems)
- **High Resolution**: 1000 Hz (research grade, oversampled)

### Recording Duration
- **SCR Detection**: ≥10 seconds (depending on stimulus)
- **Event-Related**: Typically 10-20 seconds per trial
- **Interval-Related**: ≥60 seconds for stable estimates
- **Sympathetic Index**: ≥64 seconds (frequency resolution requirement)

### Electrode Placement
- **Standard Sites**:
  - Palmar: Distal/intermediate phalanges (fingers)
  - Plantar: Sole of the foot
- **High Density**: Thenar/Hypothenar eminence
- **Avoid**: Hairy skin, areas with low sweat gland density
- **Bilateral Comparison**: Left vs. Right hand (usually similar)

### Signal Quality Issues

**Flat Signal (No Change):**
- Check electrode contact and conductive paste
- Confirm placement in sweat-gland-rich areas
- Allow 5-10 minutes for adaptation

**Excessive Noise:**
- Motion artifacts: Minimize subject movement
- Electromagnetic interference: Check grounding and shielding
- Temperature effects: Control room temperature

**Baseline Drift:**
- Normal: Slow changes over minutes
- Excessive: Electrode polarization, poor contact
- Solution: Use `eda_phasic()` to isolate tonic drift

**Non-responders:**
- Approximately 5-10% of the population has minimal EDA
- Genetic/physiological difference
- Does not necessarily indicate equipment failure

### Best Practices

**Preprocessing Workflow:**
```python
# 1. Clean signal
cleaned = nk.eda_clean(eda_raw, sampling_rate=100, method='neurokit')

# 2. Decompose Tonic/Phasic
tonic, phasic = nk.eda_phasic(cleaned, sampling_rate=100, method='cvxeda')

# 3. Detect SCRs
signals, info = nk.eda_peaks(phasic, sampling_rate=100, amplitude_min=0.05)

# 4. Analyze
analysis = nk.eda_analyze(signals, sampling_rate=100)
```

**Event-Related Workflow:**
```python
# 1. Process signal
signals, info = nk.eda_process(eda_raw, sampling_rate=100)

# 2. Find events
events = nk.events_find(trigger_channel, threshold=0.5)

# 3. Create epochs (-1 to 10s around stimulus)
epochs = nk.epochs_create(signals, events, sampling_rate=100,
                          epochs_start=-1, epochs_end=10)

# 4. Event-related analysis
results = nk.eda_eventrelated(epochs)

# 5. Statistical analysis
# Compare SCR amplitudes across different conditions
```

## Interpretation Guidelines

**SCR Amplitude:**
- **0.01-0.05 µS**: Tiny but detectable
- **0.05-0.2 µS**: Moderate response
- **>0.2 µS**: Strong response
- **Context-dependent**: Should be normalized within-subject

**SCR Frequency:**
- **Resting**: 1-3 SCRs per minute (typical)
- **Stress**: >5 SCRs per minute
- **Non-specific SCRs**: Spontaneously occurring (no clear stimulus)

**Tonic SCL:**
- **Range**: 2-20 µS (highly variable between individuals)
- **Within-subject changes** are more interpretable than absolute levels
- **Increase**: Arousal, stress, cognitive load
- **Decrease**: Relaxation, habituation
