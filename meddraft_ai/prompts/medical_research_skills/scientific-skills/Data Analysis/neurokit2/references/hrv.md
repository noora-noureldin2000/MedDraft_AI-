# Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis

## Overview

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reflects the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, providing insights into autonomic nervous system regulation, cardiovascular health, and psychological states. NeuroKit2 provides comprehensive HRV analysis across time, frequency, and non-linear domains.

## Main Functions

### hrv()

Calculates all available HRV indices from all domains at once.

```python
hrv_indices = nk.hrv(peaks, sampling_rate=1000, show=False)
```

**Input:**
- `peaks`: A dictionary containing the `'ECG_R_Peaks'` key or an array of R-peak indices.
- `sampling_rate`: The sampling rate of the signal (in Hz).

**Returns:**
- A DataFrame containing HRV indices from all domains:
  - Time-domain indices
  - Frequency-domain power spectrum
  - Non-linear complexity measures

**This is a convenient wrapper function** that combines:
- `hrv_time()`
- `hrv_frequency()`
- `hrv_nonlinear()`

## Time-Domain Analysis

### hrv_time()

Calculates time-domain HRV indices based on inter-beat intervals (IBIs).

```python
hrv_time = nk.hrv_time(peaks, sampling_rate=1000)
```

### Key Metrics

**Basic Interval Statistics:**
- `HRV_MeanNN`: Mean of the NN intervals (ms).
- `HRV_SDNN`: Standard deviation of the NN intervals (ms).
  - Reflects total HRV, capturing all cyclic components.
  - Requires ≥5 minutes for short-term analysis and ≥24 hours for long-term analysis.
- `HRV_RMSSD`: Root mean square of successive differences (ms).
  - High-frequency variability, reflecting parasympathetic activity.
  - More stable in shorter recordings.

**Difference Measures:**
- `HRV_SDSD`: Standard deviation of successive differences (ms).
  - Similar to RMSSD, correlated with parasympathetic activity.
- `HRV_pNN50`: Percentage of successive NN interval differences > 50ms.
  - Parasympathetic index, may be insensitive in certain populations.
- `HRV_pNN20`: Percentage of successive NN interval differences > 20ms.
  - A more sensitive alternative to pNN50.

**Range Measures:**
- `HRV_MinNN`, `HRV_MaxNN`: Minimum and maximum values of NN intervals (ms).
- `HRV_CVNN`: Coefficient of variation (SDNN/MeanNN).
  - A standardized measure suitable for inter-subject comparison.
- `HRV_CVSD`: Coefficient of variation of successive differences (RMSSD/MeanNN).

**Median-based Statistics:**
- `HRV_MedianNN`: Median of the NN intervals (ms).
  - Robust to outliers.
- `HRV_MadNN`: Median absolute deviation of the NN intervals.
  - A robust measure of dispersion.
- `HRV_MCVNN`: Median-based coefficient of variation.

**Advanced Time-Domain Indices:**
- `HRV_IQRNN`: Interquartile range of the NN intervals.
- `HRV_pNN10`, `HRV_pNN25`, `HRV_pNN40`: Additional percentile thresholds.
- `HRV_TINN`: Triangular interpolation of the NN interval histogram.
- `HRV_HTI`: HRV Triangular Index (Total number of NN intervals / histogram height).

### Recording Duration Requirements
- **Ultra-short-term (< 5 min)**: RMSSD and pNN50 are the most reliable.
- **Short-term (5 min)**: The standard for clinical use; all time-domain indices are valid.
- **Long-term (24 hours)**: Necessary for interpreting SDNN to capture circadian rhythms.

## Frequency-Domain Analysis

### hrv_frequency()

Analyzes HRV power in different frequency bands using spectral analysis.

```python
hrv_freq = nk.hrv_frequency(peaks, sampling_rate=1000, ulf=(0, 0.0033), vlf=(0.0033, 0.04),
                            lf=(0.04, 0.15), hf=(0.15, 0.4), vhf=(0.4, 0.5),
                            psd_method='welch', normalize=True)
```

### Frequency Bands

## Practical Considerations

### Minimum Recording Duration

| Analysis Type | Minimum Duration | Optimal Duration |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| RMSSD, pNN50  | 30 seconds       | 5 minutes        |
| SDNN          | 5 minutes        | 5 min (short), 24 hr (long) |
| LF, HF Power  | 2 minutes        | 5 minutes        |
| VLF Power     | 5 minutes        | 10+ minutes      |

| DFA           | 300 beats        | 1000+ beats      |

### Artifact Management

**Preprocessing:**
```python
# R-peak detection with artifact correction
peaks, info = nk.ecg_peaks(cleaned_ecg, sampling_rate=1000, correct_artifacts=True)

# Or manual interval processing
