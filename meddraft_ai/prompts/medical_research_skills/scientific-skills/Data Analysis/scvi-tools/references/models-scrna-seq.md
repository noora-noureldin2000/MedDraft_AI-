# Single-Cell RNA-seq Models

This document introduces the core models in scvi-tools for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

## scVI (Single-Cell Variational Inference)

**Purpose**: Unsupervised analysis, dimensionality reduction, and batch effect correction of single-cell RNA-seq data.

**Key Features**:
- Deep generative model based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE).
- Learns low-dimensional latent representations capturing biological variation.
- Automatically corrects for batch effects and technical covariates.

- Supports differential expression analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Preliminary exploration and dimensionality reduction of scRNA-seq datasets.
- Integration of data across multiple batches or studies.
- Generation of batch-corrected expression matrices.
- Probabilistic differential expression analysis.

**Basic Usage**:
```python
import scvi

# Setup data
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    layer="counts",
    batch_key="batch"
)

# Train model
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata, n_latent=30)
model.train()

# Extract results
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
normalized = model.get_normalized_expression()
```

**Key Parameters**:
- `n_latent`: Dimension of the latent space (default: 10).

# Train VeloVI
scvi.model.VELOVI.setup_anndata(adata, spliced_layer="Ms", unspliced_layer="Mu")
model = scvi.model.VELOVI(adata)
model.train()

# Get velocity estimates
latent_time = model.get_latent_time()
velocities = model.get_velocity()
```

## contrastiveVI

**Purpose**: Isolating perturbation-specific variation from background biological variation.

**Key Features**:
- Separates shared variation (common across conditions) from target-specific variation.
- Suitable for intervention studies (drug treatment, gene interference).

- Supports discovery of perturbation-specific effects.

**Use Cases**:
- Analyzing intervention experiments (drug screening, CRISPR, etc.).

    categorical_covariate_keys=["condition"]  # Control vs Treatment
)

model = scvi.model.CONTRASTIVEVI(
    adata,
    n_latent=10,        # Shared variation
    n_latent_target=5   # Target-specific variation
)
model.train()

# Extract representations
shared = model.get_latent_representation(representation="shared")
target_specific = model.get_latent_representation(representation="target")

marker_gene_mat = pd.DataFrame({
    "CD4 T cells": [1, 1, 0, 0],  # CD3D, CD4, CD8A, CD19
    "CD8 T cells": [1, 0, 1, 0],
    "B cells": [0, 0, 0, 1]
}, index=["CD3D", "CD4", "CD8A", "CD19"])

## Amortized LDA (Topic Modeling)

**Purpose**: Topic modeling of gene expression using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

**Key Features**:
