## Other De-identification Considerations

### Age and Dates

- [ ] Patients aged ≤89: Exact age or age range is acceptable
- [ ] Patients aged >89: Must be aggregated as "90 or older" or ">89 years old"
- [ ] Dates: Use only the year or relative time periods
  - Example: Use "3 months before visit" instead of "January 15, 2023"
  - Example: Use "Admitted in 2023" instead of "Admitted on March 10, 2023"

### Geographic Information

- [ ] State or Country is acceptable
- [ ] Remove specific cities (unless population >20,000 and no other identifying info)
- [ ] Remove hospital/clinic names
- [ ] Use generic descriptions: "A community hospital in the Midwest" or "A tertiary care center"

### Rare Conditions and Combinations

- [ ] Consider if an extremely rare disease itself could identify the patient
- [ ] Consider if the following combinations could identify the patient:
  - Age + Diagnosis + Geographic area + Timeframe
- [ ] Some unique details may need to be obscured
- [ ] Balance providing clinical information with protecting privacy

### Images and Charts

- [ ] All patient identifiers removed from image headers/metadata
- [ ] DICOM data cleared
- [ ] Dates removed from images
- [ ] Medical record numbers removed
- [ ] Faces cropped, blurred, or masked
- [ ] Identifying marks removed or obscured:
  - Tattoos
  - Jewelry
  - Birthmarks or unique scars (if clinically irrelevant)

- [ ] Background environment de-identified (room numbers, name tags, etc.)

### Voice and Video

- [ ] No recordings with the patient's voice (unless consent is obtained)

## Safe Harbor vs. Expert Determination

### Safe Harbor Method

- [ ] Removal of all 18 identifiers
- [ ] No actual knowledge that the remaining information could identify the individual
- [ ] The most straightforward method
- [ ] Recommended for most clinical reports

### Expert Determination Method

- [ ] Determination by a senior statistician/expert that the risk of re-identification is very small
- [ ] Methodology is documented
- [ ] Analytical methods are specified
- [ ] Conclusions are documented
- [ ] May allow for the retention of certain data elements
- [ ] Requires statistical expertise

**Method Used:** [ ] Safe Harbor  [ ] Expert Determination
