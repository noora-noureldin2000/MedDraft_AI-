# Compliance Guidelines for Clinical Reports

## HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

### Overview

The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects individually identifiable health information (Protected Health Information, PHI). All clinical reports must comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements.

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

**Definition:** Individually identifiable health information held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or medium.

**Covered Entities:**
- Healthcare providers
- Health plans
- Healthcare clearinghouses

**Business Associates:**
- All third parties providing services involving PHI
- Required to sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

### 18 HIPAA Identifiers

To achieve "Safe Harbor" de-identification, the following identifiers must be removed:

1. **Names**
2. **Geographic subdivisions smaller than a state** (except for the first three digits of a ZIP code if the population is greater than 20,000)
3. **Dates** (except year) – dates of birth, admission, discharge, death
4. **Telephone numbers**
5. **Fax numbers**
6. **Email addresses**
7. **Social Security Numbers (SSN)**
8. **Medical Record Numbers (MRN)**
9. **Health plan beneficiary numbers**
10. **Account numbers**
11. **Certificate/license numbers**
12. **Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers**
13. **Device identifiers and serial numbers**
14. **Web URLs**
15. **IP addresses**
16. **Biometric identifiers** (fingerprints, voiceprints)
17. **Full-face photographs and comparable images**
18. **Any other unique identifying characteristic or code**

### De-identification Methods

#### Method 1: Safe Harbor Method

Removal of all 18 identifiers, provided the entity **does not have** actual knowledge that the remaining information could be used to identify an individual.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Remove/redact all 18 identifiers
- Ages over 89 must be aggregated into a category of "90 or older"
- Dates may only retain the year
- Geographic areas may only include the state
- Document certification that no residual identifying information remains

#### Method 2: Expert Determination Method

Demonstration through statistical/scientific analysis that the risk of re-identification is very small.

**Requirements:**
- Performed by a qualified statistician or expert
- Document the analysis methodology
- Conclude that the risk of re-identification is minimal
- Maintain relevant documentation

### HIPAA Minimum Necessary Standard

**Principle:** Use, disclose, and request only the minimum amount of PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.

**Exceptions:**
- Treatment purposes (providers need full information)
- Disclosures authorized by the patient
- Legal requirements

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Role-based access control
- Disclosures tailored to specific purposes
- Use of limited data sets when feasible

### Patient Authorization

**When Required:**
- Uses/disclosures outside the scope of Treatment, Payment, and Operations (TPO)
- Marketing purposes
- Sale of PHI
- Psychotherapy notes
- Research (unless a waiver is obtained)

**Essential Elements of Authorization:**
- Specific description of the PHI to be used/disclosed
- Persons authorized to make the disclosure
- Persons receiving the information
- Purpose of the disclosure
- Expiration date or event
- Patient signature and date
- Right to revoke
- Notice of the potential for re-disclosure by the recipient

### HIPAA Security Rule (Electronic PHI)

**Administrative Safeguards:**
- Security management processes
- Personnel security
- Information access management
- Security awareness and training
- Security incident procedures

**Physical Safeguards:**
- Facility access controls
- Workstation use and security
- Device and media controls

**Technical Safeguards:**
- Access controls
- Audit controls
- Integrity controls
- Transmission security

### Breach Notification Rule

**Breach Definition:** Unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI that compromises its security or privacy.

**Notification Requirements:**
- **Individual Notice:** Without unreasonable delay, no later than 60 days
- **Media Notice:** If the breach affects more than 500 residents in a state or jurisdiction
- **HHS Notice:** Within 60 days for >500 individuals; annually for <500 individuals
- **Business Associate Notice to Covered Entity:** Without unreasonable delay

**Notification Content:**
- Description of the breach
- Types of information involved
- Steps individuals should take for self-protection
- Investigation/mitigation measures being taken by the entity
- Contact information for inquiries

### HIPAA Penalties for Non-compliance

**Civil Penalties (per violation):**
- Tier 1: $100 - $50,000 (Unknowing violation)
- Tier 2: $1,000 - $50,000 (Reasonable cause)
- Tier 3: $10,000 - $50,000 (Willful neglect, but corrected)
- Tier 4: $50,000 - $1.9M (Willful neglect, not corrected)

**Criminal Penalties:**

- Obtaining under false pretenses: Up to $100,000 and/or 5 years in prison
- Intent to sell/transfer/commercial gain: Up to $250,000 and/or 10 years in prison

### Research and HIPAA

**HIPAA Authorization for Research:**
- Specific to a research study
- Describes the PHI to be used
- States that PHI may not be necessary for treatment

**Waiver of Authorization:**
- Approved by an IRB or Privacy Board
- Minimal risk to privacy
- Research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver
- Research could not practicably be conducted without access to PHI
- Plan to protect identifiers
- Plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity

### ICH-GCP Principles

**1. Ethics:** Clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with ethical principles (Declaration of Helsinki, local laws).

**2. Risk-Benefit:** Trials should be scientifically justified with a favorable risk-benefit ratio.

**3. Rights and Welfare:** The rights, safety, and well-being of subjects prevail over interests of science and society.

**4. Available Information:** Trials should utilize available non-clinical and clinical information.

**5. Quality:** Trials should be scientifically sound and described in a clear, detailed protocol.

**6. Compliance:** Trials should comply with the approved protocol.

**7. Qualified Personnel:** Trials should be conducted by qualified individuals.

**8. Informed Consent:** Freely given informed consent should be obtained from every subject.

**9. Privacy:** Confidentiality of subject records must be protected.

**10. Quality Assurance:** Systems with procedures that assure the quality of every aspect of the trial should be implemented.

**11. Investigational Products:** Manufactured, handled, and stored in accordance with GMP; used in accordance with the approved protocol.

**12. Documentation:** Documentation systems should allow for accurate reporting, interpretation, and verification.

**13. Quality Management:** Sponsors should implement a system to manage quality.
