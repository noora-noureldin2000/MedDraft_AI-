> Check this case report for HIPAA compliance.
> Validate against CARE guidelines.
```

### 2. Writing Diagnostic Reports

```
> Generate a radiology report template for a chest CT.

> Write a laboratory report for a complete blood count (CBC).
```

### 3. Clinical Trial Documentation

```
> Write a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) report for a hospitalization due to pneumonia.
> Create a Clinical Study Report outline for a Phase 3 diabetes trial.
> Generate an adverse event summary table based on trial data.
```

### 4. Patient Clinical Records

## Workflow Examples

### Case Report Workflow

1. **Obtain Informed Consent**: From the patient.
2. **Generate Template**: `python generate_report_template.py --type case_report`
3. **Write Report**: Follow the CARE structure.
4. **Validate Compliance**: `python validate_case_report.py case_report.md`
5. **Check De-identification**: `python check_deidentification.py case_report.md`
6. **Submit to Journal**: Include the CARE checklist.

### Clinical Trial SAE Workflow

1. **Generate SAE Template**: `python generate_report_template.py --type sae`
2. **Fill SAE Form**: Complete within 24 hours of event awareness.
3. **Assess Causality**: Use WHO-UMC or Naranjo algorithms.
4. **Validate Completeness**: `python validate_trial_report.py sae_report.md`
5. **Submit to Sponsor**: Within regulatory timelines (7 or 15 days).
6. **Notify IRB**: According to institutional policy.

## Best Practices

### Privacy & Ethics
✓ Always obtain informed consent for case reports.  
✓ Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers before publication.  
✓ Use de-identification validation scripts.  
✓ State in the manuscript that informed consent was signed.  
✓ Assess re-identification risk for rare cases.  

### Clinical Quality
✓ Use professional medical terminology.  
✓ Follow structured reporting templates.  
✓ Include all necessary elements.  
✓ Document chronological order clearly.  
✓ Provide evidence support for diagnoses.  

### Regulatory Compliance
✓ Meet SAE reporting timelines (7 days, 15 days).  
✓ Ensure CSR follows ICH-E3 structure.  
✓ Maintain ALCOA-CCEA data integrity.  
✓ Document protocol adherence.  
✓ Use MedDRA coding for adverse events.  

### Documentation Standards
✓ Sign and date all clinical records.  
✓ Document medical necessity.  
✓ Use only standard abbreviations.  
✓ Avoid prohibited abbreviations (JCAHO "Do Not Use" list).  
✓ Maintain legibility and completeness.
