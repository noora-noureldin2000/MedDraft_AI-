# Treatment Plans Skill

## Overview

This skill is used to generate **concise and clinician-centric** medical treatment plans for all clinical specialties. It provides LaTeX/PDF templates with SMART goal frameworks, evidence-based interventions, regulatory compliance, and validation tools for patient-centered care planning.

Most cases **default to a 1-page format** — positioned as a "Quick Reference Card" rather than a "comprehensive textbook."

## What's Included

### 📋 Seven Treatment Plan Types

1. **One-Page Treatment Plan** (Preferred) — A concise, quick-reference format suitable for most clinical scenarios.
2. **General Medical Treatment Plans** — Primary care, chronic diseases (Diabetes, Hypertension, Heart Failure).
3. **Rehabilitation Treatment Plans** — Physical therapy, occupational therapy, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation.
4. **Mental Health Treatment Plans** — Psychiatric care, depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse.
5. **Chronic Disease Management Plans** — Complex multimorbidity, long-term care coordination.
6. **Perioperative Care Plans** — Preoperative optimization, ERAS protocols, postoperative recovery.
7. **Pain Management Plans** — Acute and chronic pain, multimodal analgesia, opioid reduction strategies.

## SMART Goals Framework

All treatment plans use SMART criteria for goal setting:

- **Specific**: Clear, well-defined outcomes (not vague)
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable metrics or observable behaviors
- **Achievable**: Realistic goals considering patient capacity and resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with patient priorities and values
- **Time-bound**: Defined schedule for achievement

### Examples

**Good SMART Goals**:
- Reduce HbA1c from 8.5% to <7% within 3 months
- Ambulate 150 feet independently with assistive device within 8 weeks
- Reduce PHQ-9 depression score from 18 to <10 within 8 weeks
- Achieve knee flexion >90 degrees by postoperative day 14
- Reduce pain from 7/10 to ≤4/10 within 6 weeks

**Poor Goals** (Non-SMART):
- "Feel better" (Not specific, not measurable)
- "Improve diabetes" (Not specific, no timeframe)
- "Get stronger" (Not measurable)
- "Return to normal" (Vague, not specific)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I choose the right template?

Select the template based on your primary clinical focus:
- **Chronic medical conditions** → general_medical or chronic_disease
- **Post-surgery or injury** → rehabilitation or perioperative
- **Psychiatric conditions** → mental_health
- **Pain as the primary issue** → pain_management

### What if my patient has multiple conditions?

For complex multimorbidity, use the `chronic_disease_management_plan.tex` template, or select the template for the primary condition and add sections for comorbidities.

### How often should treatment plans be updated?

- **Initial Creation**: At the time of diagnosis or start of treatment.
- **Periodic Updates**: Every 3-6 months for chronic conditions.
- **Significant Changes**: When goals are met or treatment is modified.
- **Annual Review**: Minimum requirement for all chronic disease plans.

### Can I modify the LaTeX templates?

Yes! Templates are designed to support customization. You can modify sections, add specialty-specific content, or adjust formatting as needed.

### How do I ensure HIPAA compliance?

- Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers (see Safe Harbor method).
- Use age ranges instead of exact ages (e.g., "60-65" instead of "63").
- Remove specific dates; use relative timelines.
- Omit geographic identifiers smaller than a state.
- Use the `check_deidentification.py` script from the clinical-reports skill.

### What if the validation script finds issues?

Review the specific issues identified, consult the reference files for guidance, and modify the plan accordingly. Common issues include:
- Missing required sections
- Goals that are not SMART
- Insufficient monitoring parameters
- Incomplete medication information
