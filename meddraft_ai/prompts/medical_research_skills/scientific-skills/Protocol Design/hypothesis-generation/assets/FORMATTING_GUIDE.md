## Custom Box Environments

### 1. Executive Summary Box

```latex
\begin{summarybox}[Executive Summary]
  Content here
\end{summarybox}
```

**Purpose:** Used for a concise overview at the beginning of the document.

---

### 2. Hypothesis Box (5 Variants)

```latex
\begin{hypothesisbox1}[Hypothesis 1: Title]
  \textbf{Mechanistic Explanation:}
  [2-3 paragraphs explaining HOW and WHY]
  
  \textbf{Key Supporting Evidence:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Evidence point 1 \citep{ref1}
    \item Evidence point 2 \citep{ref2}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Core Assumptions:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Assumption 1
    \item Assumption 2
  \end{enumerate}
\end{hypothesisbox1}
```

**Available Box Types:** `hypothesisbox1`, `hypothesisbox2`, `hypothesisbox3`, `hypothesisbox4`, `hypothesisbox5`

**Purpose:** To present each competing hypothesis along with its mechanism, evidence, and assumptions.

**Best Practices for 4-Page Main Body:**
- Limit mechanistic explanations to 1-2 short paragraphs (max 6-10 sentences).
- Include 2-3 of the most important evidence points with citations.
- List 1-2 of the most critical assumptions.
- Ensure each hypothesis is fundamentally distinct.
- Place all detailed explanations in Appendix A.
- **Use `\newpage` before each hypothesis box to prevent layout overflow.**
- Each complete hypothesis box should be ≤ 0.6 pages.

---

### 3. Prediction Box

```latex
\begin{predictionbox}[Predictions: Hypothesis 1]
  \textbf{Prediction 1.1:} [Specific prediction]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conditions:} When/where this applies
    \item \textbf{Expected Outcome:} Specific measurable result
    \item \textbf{Falsification:} What would disprove it
  \end{itemize}
\end{predictionbox}
```

**Purpose:** Testable predictions derived from each hypothesis.

**Best Practices for 4-Page Main Body:**
- Predictions should be as specific and quantifiable as possible.
- Clearly state the conditions under which the prediction holds.
- Always specify falsification criteria.
- Include only 1-2 of the most critical predictions per hypothesis in the main body.
- Place additional predictions in the Appendix.

---

### 4. Evidence Box

```latex
\begin{evidencebox}[Supporting Evidence]
  Content discussing supporting evidence
\end{evidencebox}
```

**Purpose:** To highlight key supporting evidence or literature reviews.

**Best Practices:**
- Use sparingly in the main body (place detailed evidence in Appendix A).
- Add citations for all evidence.
- Focus on the most compelling evidence.

---

### 5. Comparison Box

```latex
\begin{comparisonbox}[H1 vs. H2: Key Distinction]
  \textbf{Fundamental Difference:}
  [Description of core difference]
  
  \textbf{Discriminating Experiment:}
  [Description of experiment]
  
  \textbf{Outcome Interpretation:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{If [Result A]:} H1 supported
    \item \textbf{If [Result B]:} H2 supported
  \end{itemize}
\end{comparisonbox}
```

**Purpose:** To explain how to distinguish between competing hypotheses.

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on fundamental mechanistic differences.
- Propose clear, actionable discriminating experiments.
- Specify interpretations for specific experimental outcomes.
- Create comparisons for all major hypothesis pairs.

---

### 6. Limitation Box

```latex
\begin{limitationbox}[Limitations \& Challenges]
  Discussion of limitations
\end{limitationbox}
```

**Purpose:** To emphasize important limitations or challenges.

**Best Practices:**
- Use when limitations are particularly significant.
- Be honest about challenges.
- Suggest how these limitations might be addressed.

---

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\tableheadercolor
\textcolor{white}{\textbf{Header 1}} & \textcolor{white}{\textbf{Header 2}} \\
\hline
Data row 1 & Data \\
\hline
\tablerowcolor  % Alternating row background
Data row 2 & Data \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Your caption}
\end{hypotable}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `\tableheadercolor` for the header row.
- Use `\tablerowcolor` for alternating backgrounds in tables longer than 3 rows.
- Maintain table readability (do not make them too wide).
- Use for quality assessments and comparisons.

## Common Formatting Patterns

### Hypothesis Section Pattern

```latex
% Use \newpage before hypothesis boxes to prevent overflow
\newpage
\subsection*{Hypothesis N: [Concise Title]}

\begin{hypothesisboxN}[Hypothesis N: [Title]]

\textbf{Mechanistic Explanation:}

[1-2 brief paragraphs of explanation - 6-10 sentences max]

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Key Supporting Evidence:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item [Evidence 1] \citep{ref1}
  \item [Evidence 2] \citep{ref2}
  \item [Evidence 3] \citep{ref3}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Core Assumptions:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item [Assumption 1]
  \item [Assumption 2]
\end{enumerate}

\end{hypothesisboxN}

\vspace{0.5cm}
```

**Note:** The `\newpage` before the hypothesis box ensures it starts on a fresh page, preventing layout overflow. This is especially important when the box contains substantial content.

### Prediction Section Pattern

```latex
\subsection*{Predictions from Hypothesis N}

\begin{predictionbox}[Predictions: Hypothesis N]

\textbf{Prediction N.1:} [Statement]
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Conditions:} [Conditions]
  \item \textbf{Expected Outcome:} [Outcome]
  \item \textbf{Falsification:} [Falsification]
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{Prediction N.2:} [Statement]
[... continue ...]

\end{predictionbox}
```

### Comparison Section Pattern

```latex
\subsection*{Distinguishing Hypothesis X vs. Hypothesis Y}

\begin{comparisonbox}[HX vs. HY: Key Distinction]

\textbf{Fundamental Difference:}

[Description of core difference]

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Discriminating Experiment:}

[Experiment description]

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Outcome Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{If [Result A]:} HX supported
  \item \textbf{If [Result B]:} HY supported
  \item \textbf{If [Result C]:} Both/neither supported
\end{itemize}

\end{comparisonbox}
```

## Spacing and Layout

### Vertical Spacing
- `\vspace{0.3cm}` - Between elements within a box.
- `\vspace{0.5cm}` - Between major sections or boxes.
- `\vspace{1cm}` - After the title, before main content.

### Pagination and Overflow Prevention

**Key: Prevent Content Overflow**

LaTeX boxes (tcolorbox environments) do not automatically break across pages. If the content exceeds the remaining space on the current page, it will overflow, causing formatting issues. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Strategically Page Break Before Long Boxes:**
```latex
\newpage  % Start on a new page if the box has significant content
\begin{hypothesisbox1}[Hypothesis 1: Title]
  % Substantial content
\end{hypothesisbox1}
```

2. **Monitor Box Content Length:**
   - Each hypothesis box should be max ≤ 0.7 pages.
   - If the mechanistic explanation + evidence + assumptions exceed ~0.6 pages, the content is too long.
   - Solution: Move detailed content to the Appendix and keep only core points in the main body box.

3. **When to use `\newpage`:**
   - Before any hypothesis box containing >3 subsections or >15 lines of content.
   - Before comparison boxes containing detailed experimental descriptions.
   - Between major Appendix sections.
   - If the remaining space on the current page is less than 0.6 pages and a new box is about to start.

4. **Main Body Content Length Guidelines:**
   - Executive Summary Box: Max 0.5-0.8 pages.
   - Each Hypothesis Box: Max 0.4-0.6 pages.
   - Each Prediction Box: Max 0.3-0.5 pages.
   - Each Comparison Box: Max 0.4-0.6 pages.

5. **Splitting Overly Long Content:**
   ```latex
   % Correct approach: Concise main body with pagination
   \newpage
   \begin{hypothesisbox1}[Hypothesis 1: Brief Title]
   \textbf{Mechanistic Explanation:}
   Brief overview in 1-2 paragraphs (6-10 sentences).
   
   \textbf{Key Supporting Evidence:}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Evidence 1 \citep{ref1}
     \item Evidence 2 \citep{ref2}
   \end{itemize}
   
   \textbf{Core Assumptions:}
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item Assumption 1
   \end{enumerate}
   
   See Appendix A for detailed mechanism and comprehensive evidence.
   \end{hypothesisbox1}
   ```

   ```latex
   % Incorrect approach: Content too long, causing overflow
   \begin{hypothesisbox1}[Hypothesis 1]
   \subsection{Very Long Section}
   Multiple paragraphs...
   \subsection{Another Long Section}
   More paragraphs...
   \subsection{Even More Content}
   [Content continues past page boundary → OVERFLOW!]
   \end{hypothesisbox1}
   ```

6. **Pagination Commands:**
   - `\newpage` - Forces a page break (recommended before long boxes).
   - `\clearpage` - Forces a page break and flushes floats (use before the Appendix).

### Section Spacing
The style package has presets, but you can fine-tune:
```latex
\vspace{0.5cm}  % Add extra space if needed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: "File hypothesis_generation.sty not found"**
- Solution: Ensure the .sty file is in the same directory as your .tex file or in your LaTeX path.

**Problem: Boxes have no color**
- Solution: Compile with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX, not pdfLaTeX.
- Command: `xelatex yourfile.tex`

**Problem: Citations appear as [?]**
- Solution: Run bibtex after the first xelatex compilation.
```bash
xelatex yourfile.tex
bibtex yourfile
xelatex yourfile.tex
xelatex yourfile.tex
```

**Problem: Fonts not found**
- Solution: If custom fonts are not installed, comment out the font lines in the .sty file.
- Lines to comment: `\setmainfont{...}` and `\setsansfont{...}`.

**Problem: Box title overlaps with content**
- Solution: Add `\vspace{0.3cm}` after the title.

**Problem: Table is too wide**
- Solution: Use `\small` or `\footnotesize` before the tabular, or use `p{width}` column width settings.

**Problem: Content overflows the page**
- **Cause:** The box (tcolorbox) is too long to fit in the remaining space on the current page.
- **Solution 1:** Add `\newpage` before the box.
- **Solution 2:** Trim box content - move details to the Appendix.
- **Solution 3:** Break content into multiple smaller boxes.
- **Prevention:** Keep each hypothesis box between 0.4-0.6 pages; use `\newpage` liberally for long content.

**Problem: Main body exceeds 4 pages**
- **Cause:** Boxes contain too much detailed information.
- **Solution:** Decisively move content to the Appendix - the main body boxes should only contain:
  - Brief mechanistic overview (1-2 paragraphs)
  - 2-3 core evidence points
  - 1-2 core assumptions
- All detailed explanations, extra evidence, and comprehensive discussions belong in Appendix A.

### Package Requirements

Ensure the following packages are installed:
- `tcolorbox` (with `most` option)
- `xcolor`
- `fontspec` (for XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX)
- `fancyhdr`
- `titlesec`
- `enumitem`
- `booktabs`
- `natbib`

Installing missing packages:
```bash
# For TeX Live
tlmgr install tcolorbox xcolor fontspec fancyhdr titlesec enumitem booktabs natbib

# For MiKTeX (Windows)
# Use MiKTeX Package Manager GUI
```

## Style Consistency Tips

1. **Color Usage**
   - Consistently use the same color for each hypothesis throughout the document.
   - H1 = Blue, H2 = Green, H3 = Purple, etc.
   - Do not mix multiple colors for a single hypothesis.

2. **Box Usage**
   - Main Body: Hypothesis boxes, Prediction boxes, Comparison boxes.
   - Appendix: Use Evidence boxes and Limitation boxes as needed.
   - Do not over-use boxes - reserve them for key content.

3. **Citation Style**
   - Maintain consistent citation formatting throughout.
   - Use `\citep{}` for most citations.
   - Combine multiple citations: `\citep{ref1, ref2, ref3}`.

4. **Hypothesis Numbering**
   - Keep hypothesis numbering consistent (H1, H2, H3, etc.).
   - Use the same numbering in predictions (P1.1, P1.2 for H1).
   - Use the same numbering in comparisons (H1 vs. H2).

5. **Language**
   - Be precise and specific.
   - Avoid vague terms ("maybe", "perhaps").
   - Use active voice whenever possible.
   - Make predictions as quantifiable as possible.
