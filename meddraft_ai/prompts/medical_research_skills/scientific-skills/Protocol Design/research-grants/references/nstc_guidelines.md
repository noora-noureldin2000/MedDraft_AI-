- **80 and below**: Not recommended for approval.

**Core Insight**: The gap between "Passing" (81) and "Excellent" (88+) often lies in the strength of preliminary data, clarity of innovation, and the persuasiveness of feasibility.

---

### Writing Strategies by Section

#### Abstract

**Reviewer Expectations**:
- Must immediately demonstrate **innovation** and **problem-solving strategies**.
- Should grab the reviewer's attention upon first reading.
- Clearly state how this project differs from existing work.

**Key Question**: Does the abstract make the reviewer want to read the rest of the proposal?

#### Research Background and Motivation

**Reviewer Focus**:
- **Clear Problem Definition**: Is the core problem well-defined?
- **Reasonable Design and Objectives**: Are the goals achievable and well-supported?
- **Logical Flow**: Does the background lead naturally to the research objectives?

**Common Weakness**: Vague problem descriptions that fail to identify the specific research gap you are filling.

#### Literature Review

**Quality over Quantity**:
- Select **highly relevant** literature rather than just listing a large number of papers.
- **Critical Synthesis**: Don't just list papers; analyze strengths, weaknesses, and gaps.
- **Timeliness**: Include publications from the **last 2-3 years** to show mastery of the current cutting edge.
- **Strategic Positioning**: Use the review to lead the reader to agree with your research goals.

**Reviewer Perspective**: A curated review of 20 papers with critical analysis is far superior to a list of 50 papers without synthesis.

## Advanced Writing Strategies from Senior Reviewers

> 📚 **Source**: This section integrates insights from two comprehensive guides:
> 1. "How to Improve the Quality of Government S&T Development Proposals" by **Prof. Yao-Huang Kuo**.
> 2. "How to Improve the Quality of Government S&T Development Proposals" by **President Yao-Hui Wei** of Mackay Medical College.
>
> These guides are based on extensive experience reviewing government S&T projects, including NSTC and other ministerial programs.

### Closed-Loop Logic Framework

**Core Principle**: A high-quality proposal must demonstrate complete logical consistency from problem to performance.

**The Logic Loop**:
```
Identify Problem → Define Objectives → Formulate Strategy → 
Specific Measures → Execution Plan → Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
```

**Key Requirement**: Every element must be tightly linked logically.

**Example of a Logical Break**:
- ❌ **Objective**: Improve industrial technology.
- ❌ **Strategy**: Provide student scholarships.
- **Problem**: The strategy does not directly support the objective.

**Example of a Logical Loop**:
- ✅ **Objective**: Improve industrial technology.
- ✅ **Strategy**: Develop advanced manufacturing processes.
- ✅ **Measures**: Establish testing facilities, train engineers.
- ✅ **KPI**: Achieve a 15% efficiency increase, train 20 engineers.

### SMART Principles for Project Planning

Before writing, ensure your project meets the **SMART** criteria:

| Criterion | Meaning | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **S**pecific | Clear objectives | Define precise technical metrics (e.g., "Improve accuracy to 95%"). |
| **M**easurable | Quantifiable KPIs | Use numbers, percentages, or counts. |
| **A**chievable | Realistic scale | Match with available resources, personnel, equipment, and budget. |
| **R**ealistic | Scientifically grounded | Based on data and logical reasoning. |
| **T**imely | Clear schedule | Specific milestones with dates. |

---

### The Four Dimensions of Review Criteria

Reviewers evaluate proposals across four key dimensions:

#### 1. **Necessity**
- Does it align with national S&T policy?
- Is there an urgent need for this research?
- Why must this problem be solved **now**?
- Why is **your institution** the right choice for this task?

**Poor Proposal**: Generalities without urgency.  
**Strong Proposal**: Cites specific policy documents and demonstrates time-sensitive needs.

#### 2. **Feasibility**
- Can the goals be achieved within the proposed timeframe?
- Is the team qualified (past performance, expertise)?
- Is the methodology rigorous and well-supported?
- Is the management plan realistic?

**Red Flag**: Overly ambitious goals lacking preliminary data or risk mitigation.

#### 3. **Appropriateness**
- Does the budget match the scope of work?
- Is the personnel allocation reasonable?
- Are existing facilities being used effectively?
- Are high-cost items fully justified?

**Reviewer Question**: Why is this expensive equipment needed if similar facilities already exist?

#### 4. **Impact and Benefits**
- Beyond academic output, what are the societal impacts?
- What are the economic benefits or industrial applications?
- Impact on environment, health, or national security?
- What is the long-term sustainability?

**Core Insight**: Reviewers increasingly value **societal impact** over pure academic metrics.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Three Levels

Understanding the difference between inputs, outputs, and outcomes is vital:

| Level | Type | Example | Reviewer Value |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Input** | Resources invested | Personnel, budget, equipment | Basic requirement |
| **Output** | Direct products | Papers, patents, conferences | Minimum expectation |
| **Outcome** | Real-world impact | Industrial adoption, health improvement, policy change | **High Value** |

**Comparison Example**:
- ❌ **Weak KPI**: "Publish 3 papers" (Output only).
- ✅ **Strong KPI**: "Publish 3 papers in Q1 journals AND transfer technology to 2 companies, generating NT$5M in licensing revenue" (Output + Outcome).

**KPI Best Practices**:
- **Relevance**: Directly linked to project goals.
- **Convenience**: Easy to measure and verify.
- **Credibility**: Based on realistic projections.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Achievable within the budget.

**Progressive Goals**: Show year-by-year progress rather than just the final target.
- Year 1: 30% completion.
- Year 2: 70% completion.
- Year 3: 100% completion + sustainability plan.

---

### Practical Analysis Tools

#### SWOT Analysis

Use SWOT to strategically position your proposal:

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Your unique expertise | Resource limitations |
| Existing facilities | Lack of certain specific skills |
| Strong past performance | Time constraints |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| Policy alignment | Competing teams |
| Industry partnerships | Rapid tech changes |
| Emerging trends | Budget cuts |

**Key**: Don't just list SWOT—**provide strategies** to address weaknesses and threats.

**Example**:
- **Weakness**: Lack of high-performance computing cluster.
- **Mitigation**: Collaboration with the National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC).

#### Fishbone Diagram

Use a Fishbone diagram to show deep understanding of the problem:

```
                    Core Problem
                         ↑
        ┌───────┬────────┼────────┬───────┐
      Factor 1  Factor 2  Factor 3  Factor 4
        │         │         │         │
      Sub-cause Sub-cause Sub-cause Sub-cause
```

**Purpose**: Demonstrate to reviewers that you have analyzed root causes, not just surface symptoms.

#### Gantt Chart

For complex multi-year projects, use a Gantt chart to show:
- Task dependencies.
- Resource allocation over time.
- Milestones and deliverables.
- Risk management checkpoints.

**Professional Presentation**: Use visualization tools to demonstrate project management capability.

---

### Budgeting: Critical Details

#### Necessity and Reasonableness

**Every budget item must answer two questions**:
1. **Why is this necessary?** (Link to specific research activities).
2. **How was this calculated?** (Show detailed breakdown).

**Example - Equipment Justification**:
- ❌ **Weak**: "High-performance workstation: NT$150,000."
- ✅ **Strong**: "High-performance workstation (Intel Xeon 32-core, 128GB RAM, RTX 4090 GPU) for deep learning model training: NT$150,000. Existing lab PCs (8GB RAM) cannot handle the 50GB datasets required for Objective 2. Estimated training time reduction from 2 weeks to 2 days."

#### Budget Categories

**Core Rule**: Strictly distinguish between "Recurrent" and "Capital" expenditures.

**Recurrent**:
- Personnel costs.
- Travel.
- Consumables.
- Publication fees.

**Capital**:
- Equipment with unit price ≥ NT$10,000 and life ≥ 2 years.
- Items ≥ NT$200,000 may require price comparisons.

**Taboo**: Using S&T funds for general administrative work.

#### Outsourcing Fees

If including outsourcing:
- Define the specific scope of work.
- Explain why it cannot be done in-house.
- Describe the selection and supervision process.
- Provide a cost breakdown.

#### International Conference Travel

**Typical Range**: NT$70,000 - 100,000.

**Essential Justification**:
- Your past record of international conference presentations.
- Specific conference names and dates (if known).
- How attendance benefits the research (networking, collaboration, dissemination).
- Why the conference is significant for your field.

---

### Common Negative Reviewer Feedback to Avoid

Based on actual feedback from government project reviews:

#### 1. **Vague Objectives**
- ❌ "Promote the development of..."
- ❌ "Research on..."
- ✅ "Develop an algorithm that achieves 95% accuracy on benchmark X."

#### 2. **Redundancy and Overlap**
- **Problem**: Multiple agencies funding similar work.
- **Solution**: Clearly differentiate from existing projects; coordinate with other ministries before submission.

#### 3. **Lack of Continuity Explanation**
- **For Continued Projects**: Must explain the relationship between previous results and the new application.
- Show how you are building on past work (not repeating it).

#### 4. **Technology Push Without Market Pull**
- **Problem**: Developing technology without considering industrial needs or market readiness.
- **Solution**: Include industry letters of intent, market analysis, or user needs assessments.

#### 5. **Ignoring Negative Impacts**
- **Common Oversight**: Privacy concerns, environmental impact, ethical issues.
- **Solution**: Include risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

#### 6. **Excessive Administrative Overhead**
- **Problem**: Too many Project Management Offices (PMOs) or coordinators.
- **Solution**: Justify the administrative structure based on project complexity.

#### 7. **Missing Customer Definition**
- **Problem**: Who will use your research results?
- **Answer**: Clearly define your target users/beneficiaries.
