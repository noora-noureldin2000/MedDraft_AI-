5.1 The Importance of Humane Endpoints
    Setting clear humane endpoints is the core embodiment of the Refinement principle to ensure that scientific goals are achieved
    Strike a balance with animal welfare and avoid unnecessary animal suffering.

5.2 Specific endpoint indicators

    Major Endpoints:
    - Weight loss >20% (no recovery for 3 consecutive days)
    - Continued inability to eat or drink for >24 hours
    - Severe dyspnea, cyanosis
    - Abnormal body temperature (<36°C or >40°C) lasting more than 4 hours
    - Unable to move independently or extremely weak

    Minor Endpoints:
    - Obvious pain behavior (hunched back, huddled, inactive)
    - Self-destructive behavior
    - Unusual aggressive behavior or social withdrawal
    - Surgical site infection that does not improve
    - Tumor volume exceeds preset limit

5.3 Endpoint execution
    - Discovery Indicator: Any human discovery is immediately notified to researchers and veterinarians
    - Assessment confirmation: joint assessment by veterinarians and researchers
    - Execution time: Euthanasia will be carried out within 1 hour after confirmation
    - Recording requirements: Detailed records of discovery time, indicators, and processing procedures

5.4 Exceptions
    If the scientific endpoint conflicts with the humane endpoint, IACUC approval must be obtained in advance and set:
    - Demonstration of scientific necessity
    - Minimal pain prolongation plan
    - Additional monitoring measures
